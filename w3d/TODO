Open bugs and stuff required to fix them:

 - there is something really wrong in the truncation table code 
 - segfaults when bitstream limit is very high
    (we better should check malloc return codes)
 - there are strange errors accumulating over time ...
    (probably incomplete initialisation)
 - add the pnsr tools
 - use Simon's pnm routines, support grayscale images, ppmdiff->pnmdiff


Wavelet-related TODO's:

 - implement truncation table setup
 - arithmetic binary entropy coders may be faster, simpler and more efficient;
    implement the ZP-Coder
 - oggetize the stream format
 - write avitotarkin/quicktimetotarkin/mpegtotarkin/player/recorder
    (a libsndfile/libaudiofile alike video library would be great !)
 - profile
 - add special transform functions for large strides to prevent cache misses
 - introduce fast paths in coefficient decoder if (mps == 0)
 - mmx/3dnow/sse/altivec


Other:

 - think about a multiresolution multidimensional motion detection scheme
 - the wavelet codec could be used for still image compression too
    (we just have to define a file format with all goodies you can imagine;) 
 - to make it perfect someone has to write a good bilevel compressor and
    mask seperation algorithm
