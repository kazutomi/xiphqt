Version 1.1 (April 1, 2004):
	* mp3_support option added to permit MP3 support to be disabled.
	Handy for testing firmwares that lack MP3 support.
	* Fixed serious bug that caused deletion of multiple files to be done
	incorrectly.
	* Positron now preserves the access and modification times of files
	when copying them to the Neuros, allowing the use of standard
	synchronization tools like rsync.
	* Major improvement of MP3 detection and parsing code.
	* Vastly improved database sorting, including sorting by track number.
	Note that you will need to use "positron rebuild" to resort your
	existing databases.
	* Database handling fix that forces firmwares after 1.41 to cache 
	the database when it is modified.
	* Informational messages when scanning directories for files so
	you know something is going on.
	* Better error reporting when database directory is not present.
	* Ogg Vorbis support turned on by default.
	* Eliminated warnings in Python 2.3 about character encodings
	in *_zip.py files.
	
Version 1.0 (June 19, 2003):
	* Ogg Vorbis support added.  (Turned off by default)  Requires 
	vorbis and ogg python modules by Andrew Chatham.  
	THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOUR NEUROS PLAY OGG VORBIS FILES.  
	You still need a Vorbis-capable firmware, which has not been 
	released yet.
	* Minor documentation fixes and manpage updates.  Added
	explanation of how to format the Neuros to the troubleshooting
	guide.
	* Tips for positron developers added to HACKING.
	* Fixed bug that prevented ID3v2 tags from taking precedence over
	v1 tags when both were present.
	* Fixed bug preventing databases from being sorted during sync
	rebuild.

Version 1.0b2 (May 28, 2003):
	* Dual licensed MP3Info.py under both Xiph.org BSD and GPL
	* User's Guide and Developer's Guide added
	* Fixed crashing while using "positron del"
	* Albums, Artists, and Genres are now sorted on the Neuros
	* Fixed a problem that caused 35 second MP3s to crash positron
	* Improved MP3 detection
	* Files with illegal characters in the filename or in the tags are
	  handled now.  The characters are changed (usually to underscores)
	  to prevent Neuros lockups.
	* Files are now correctly uploaded to both the Flash and the HD
	  Neuros configurations.  (Before only the HD would work.)

Version 1.0b1 (May 22, 2003):
	* Initial public release
