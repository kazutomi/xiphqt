<h1>Positron User's Guide: Configuration</h1>

<p>
Now that you've got the operating system all set, and positron
installed, it's time to create a positron configuration file.  Login
as a normal user, connect your Neuros to your computer, and mount it.
</p>

<h2>Guided Configuration</h2>

<p>
Positron includes a command to help you generate and modify the
configuration file.  The next few sections will guide you through a
sample configuration.  To begin configuration, type the following:

<pre>
positron config
</pre>
Positron will now ask you a series of questions that will allow it 
to generate a configuration file for you.
</p>

<h3>Setting the Mountpoint</h3>

<p>
<pre>
Positron configuration

Please connect your Neuros to your computer and mount it.
Press return when ready.
</pre>

Hopefully, you've already done this.  If not, now is the time.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Where is your Neuros mounted? []
</pre>

This the mountpoint you specified during 
<a href="install.html#mount">installation</a>.  If you followed the
example, your answer will be <tt>/mnt/neuros</tt>.  Pressing enter
without typing anything will automatically select the answer given in
brackets.  Since you don't already have a configuration file, nothing
is shown in the brackets.
</p>

<p>
If your Neuros is mounted to the directory you type in, you should see
the message:
<pre>
Neuros found at that mountpoint.
</pre>
If it is not mounted, or you type the wrong directory, you will see
the message:
<pre>
Warning: A Neuros does not appear to be mounted at /blah.
Would you like to try a different mountpoint? [Y/n]
</pre>
Here you can type <tt>y</tt> to go back and change your answer.
</p>

<h3>Synchronizing Recordings</h3>

<p>
Once you select the mountpoint, the config script will ask you:
<pre>
Positron can copy new FM and microphone recordings from your Neuros to your
computer when you synchronize with "positron sync".

Would you like to enable this feature? [Y/n]
</pre>
This is a useful feature if you want the recordings you make with
the Neuros to be saved to your computer's hard disk automatically
during synchronization.  If you select this option, you will be asked 
to pick a directory:
<pre>
Where should recordings be copied to? []
=>
</pre>
You can pick any directory, include one inside a directory you plan to
make a synchronization point (see next question).
</p>

<h3>Selecting syncpoints</h3>

<p>
<pre>
Positron can automatically find new music files in the directories you
specify and copy them to the Neuros during synchronization.

Would you like to configure this? [Y/n]
</pre>

This question is asking if you want to select one or more directories
(called "synchronization points" or "syncpoints" for short in this
document) to watch for new music files.  Whenever you run <tt>positron
sync</tt>, positron will search all of the syncpoints, and all of
their subdirectories, for files that have not been loaded onto the
Neuros and copy them.  This is very convenient if you want to keep a
copy of your entire music collection on the Neuros.  If you have a 128
MB Neuros, you probably will not want to use this feature, as it is
very likely your music collection is bigger than 128 MB.  You can
manually add and remove files without defining syncpoints, as
described in the section on <a href="common-tasks.html#add">adding
music tracks</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to configure syncpoints, you will be taken to a menu:
<pre>
Synchronized directories
------------------------
(Format: [source directory] => [subdirectory on neuros]

No synchronized directories specified!

[a]dd another synchronized directory
[r]emove a synchronized directory
[d]one configuring
Command? [a]
</pre>

Since this is your first time configuring, no syncpoints are defined.
The <tt>a</tt> option will let you create a new syncpoint:
<pre>
Enter the directory on your computer to synchronize with.
=>
</pre>

Type the name of the music folder on your computer here.  
(For example, I store all my music in <tt>/home/stan/music</tt>.)

<pre>
Enter the subdirectory on the Neuros to copy files to.  Do not include the path
to the Neuros mountpoint. [Leave blank to use default]
=>
</pre>

Files and directories inside the syncpoint you specified
above will be copied into this directory on the Neuros. 
<tt>MUSIC<tt> is the default answer to this question.
</p>

<p>
To see how this works, consider the following scenario:
<ul>
  <li>Your Neuros is mounted at <tt>/mnt/neuros</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>/home/stan/music</tt> is a syncpoint.</li>
  <li><tt>tunes</tt> is the corresponding destination directory</li>
</ul>
Then the file <tt>/home/stan/music/a.mp3</tt> will be copied to
</tt>/mnt/neuros/tunes/a.mp3</tt> when you synchronize.
</p>

<h3>Finishing</h3>

<p>
Once you have the syncpoints configred to your satisfaction, you can
say that you are done configuring:

<pre>
Synchronized directories
------------------------
(Format: [source directory] => [subdirectory on neuros]

1) /home/stan/music => MUSIC

[a]dd another synchronized directory
[r]emove a synchronized directory
[d]one configuring
Command? [d] d


New Configuration
-----------------

Neuros Mountpoint = /mnt/neuros
Recording Directory = /home/stan/music/recordings

Synchronized directories
------------------------
(Format: [source directory] => [subdirectory on neuros]

1) /home/stan/music => MUSIC

Write this configuration to disk? [Y/n]
</pre>
If you say yes here, the configuration will be written, and you
will be ready to start using positron.
</p>

<h2>Configuration File Format</h2>

<p>
You can also edit the configuration file directly.  The positron
config files is stored by default in <tt>~/.positron/config</tt>.  You
can edit it as a normal text file.  It is composed of two types of entries:

<ul>

  <li>Key-value pair - This is a name followed by an equal sign,
  followed by the value.  Spaces around the value are trimmed, and if
  the value needs to contain a space, it should be enclosed in
  quotes.</li>

  <li>Block - This starts with <tt>begin</tt> and the name of the type
  of block, and is followed by <tt>end</tt> and the name of the
  block.  Inside the block are key-value pairs.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
A sample configuration file is shown below.
</p>

<pre>
mountpoint=/mnt/neuros
recordingdir=/home/stan/music/recordings
neuros_musicdir=MUSIC
sort_database=true

begin sync
  src=/home/stan/music
  dest=tunes
end sync
</pre>

<h3>Allowed Keys</h3>

<dl>
<dt>mountpoint</dt>
<dd>The directory where the Neuros is mounted.</dd>

<dt>recordingdir</dt>
<dd>The directory where recordings on the Neuros are copied to during
synchronziation.</dd>

<dt>neuros_musicdir</dt>
<dd>The subdirectory on the Neuros (inside the mountpoint) where music
files are copied to by default.  This is used both by the add and by
the sync command as the default destination. The default value for
this if not specified is <tt>MUSIC</tt>.</dd>

<dt>sort_database</dt>

<dd>A boolean key that sets whether the database should be sorted
after new entries are added.  This affects the display of songs on the
Neuros.  If this value is set to false, new songs will be shown at the
end of lists. Allowed values are <tt>true</tt>, <tt>yes</tt>,
<tt>false</tt>, or <tt>no</tt>.
</dd>

<dt>oggvorbis_support</dt>

<dd>A boolean key that sets whether positron should recognize Ogg
Vorbis files as music files.  Setting this to <tt>true</tt> will allow
Ogg Vorbis files to be uploaded to the Neuros. <em>Warning: If your
Neuros does not have a version of the firmware which supports Ogg
Vorbis files, DO NOT TURN THIS ON.</em> This option defaults to
<tt>false</tt>.  </dd> </dl>

<h3>Blocks</h3>

<h4>sync</h4>

<p>
Zero or more sync blocks are allowed in the configuration file.
The sync block defines a syncpoint.  Music files are copied from the
syncpoint to the specified destination directory on the Neuros.  The keys that can appear inside a sync block are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>src</dt>

<dd>(Required) The directory on the computer where music files should be copied
from.  All subdirectories of this directory will also be searched.</dd>

<dt>dest</dt>

<dd>(Optional) The subdirectory on the Neuros (inside the mountpoint)
where music files from <tt>src</tt> should be copied.  If not
specified, <tt>neuros_musicdir</tt> will be used by default.</dd>
</dl>
