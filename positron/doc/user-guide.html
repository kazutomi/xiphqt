<h1>Positron User's Guide: Version 1.0</h1>

<p>
Positron is a synchronization tool for the 
<a href="http://www.neurosaudio.com">Neuros</a> portable music player.
Positron allows you to individually add and delete tracks from a
Neuros, as well as synchronize it with a directory tree of music, all
from the command line.  This document will teach you how to install
and use positron.
</p>

<h2>Why Do I Need Positron?</h2>

<p>
This is a common question.  As far as your computer is concerned, a
Neuros is just an external USB 1 hard disk, following the USB Mass
Storage standard.  No custom drivers are needed.  You can copy any sort
of file, music or otherwise, onto the Neuros.  However, only files
that are listed in a special database stored on the Neuros will be
playable.  This is what positron does.  It will both physically
copy files and update the Neuros database so those files are
playable.  If you copy music to the Neuros using cp or a filemanager,
it will not be shown in the song listings.
