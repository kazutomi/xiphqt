    <h1>The XSPF Playlist Format, version 0</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This document describes a playlist format named "XSPF", which
      stands for "XML Shareable Playlist Format". "XSPF" can be
      pronounced "spiff" or maybe "spliff."</p>

    <h2>Publication status and authorship</h2>

    <p>This is an informal document not associated with any standards
      body. It is intended to be clear and readable rather than
      conformant with existing standards for such documents.</p>

    <p>This is the fourth draft of this document.  It is a major
      rewrite, and there are a number of areas where the result is
      rough.  This document assumes that your browser supports CSS
      reasonably well; versions of Internet Explorer older than
      version 6 don't.  Items marked like [[fixme: this]] are markers
      for work yet to be done.  See <a href="#Todo list">the todo
      list</a> for more details about this document.</p>

    <p>The home of our working group is <a href="http://xspf.org">http://xspf.org</a>. On
      IRC, we use #playlist on irc.freenode.net. There are perhaps six regular
      contributors, with another six commenting from time to time. Contributors came from
      two major audio software vendors, a major weblog aggregator, the W3C, and two
      significant .org sites related to music. We worked in the skunkworks style and were
      not sponsored by any organization or standards body. Our purpose was to engineer a
      high-quality design rather than to create normative requirements for
      interoperability.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The genesis of this project came from the mutual recognition that the quality of
      playlist formats fell far below the normal standard for hypertext document types like
      HTML, RDF and Atom. Our goals were to create a playlist format that is all three of:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open -- existing formats are either ad-hoc standards with no
        owner, like M3U, or proprietary, like ASX.</li>
      <li>Portable -- you should be able to send a playlist sans
        content to your friend, or open the same playlist with
        different software on the same machine, and have it be
        usable. Existing formats lack a number of features needed to
        make this work well.</li>
      <li>Well made -- there is a glaring lack of craftsmanship to
        existing formats.  For example, no dominant playlist format
        declares a namespace.  And while there are independent efforts
        to write a format with a high level of craftsmanship, the
        Gnomoradio format for example, writing data formats is too
        hard to succeed without a team.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Over the course of our work we also realized that the format
      had to <em>scale down</em> well.  The dominant playlist format is M3U,
      which is just a flat listing of song paths, and many developers
      are satisfied enough to stick with it.  SMIL is all three of
      open, portable and well made, but is too complex for many needs;
      simple SMIL playlists are not simple to implement.  Similarly,
      RDF offered well made solutions to many problems we faced, but RDF
      tools are never trivial (as of this writing).  We went to great
      lengths to make trivial playlists trivial to implement.</p>

	<p>The most pressing question for software developers is <em>why
	should I support this XML playlist format</em> instead of or in
	addition to ASX, SMIL, Gnomoradio RDF, iTunes XML, or RSS?  Why
	does the world need yet another XML playlist format?  The answer
	is <em>XSPF is by far the most carefully crafted XML playlist
	format</em>.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    A very simple document looks like this: 
    <p class="example">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;playlist version="0" xmlns = "http://xspf.org/ns/0/"&gt;
    &lt;trackList&gt;
        &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo%20La%20Tengo/Nuclear%20War/1_Nuclear%20War%20Version%201.mp3&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
        &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo%20La%20Tengo/Nuclear%20War/2_Nuclear%20War%20Version%202.mp3&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
        &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo%20La%20Tengo/Nuclear%20War/3_Nuclear%20War%20Version%203.mp3&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
        &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo%20La%20Tengo/Nuclear%20War/4_Nuclear%20War%20Version%204&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
        &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo%20La%20Tengo/Nuclear%20War/5_Nuclear%20War%20Version%204%20(Mike%20Ladd%20Remix).mp3&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
    &lt;/trackList&gt; 
&lt;/playlist&gt;</p>

	<h2>Design and architecture</h2>

	<dl>

	  <dt>User agents</dt>

	  <dd>

		<p>On a surface level you can use XSPF like any other playlist
		  format.  Drop a bunch of filenames into an XSPF document, prepend
		  "file://" to each, and you're ready to go.  Under the surface
		  there is much more.</p>
		
		<p>The guiding design principle was to separate the functionality
		  of a catalog of files from the functionality of a list of songs.
		  Most MP3 players have some sort of cache for file information.
		  This cache stores a list, or catalog, of available files and
		  metadata from ID3 tags and other sources.  XSPF is not a catalog
		  format.  XSPF exists only to say which songs to play.  Almost
		  everything in XSPF is for the purpose of answering the
		  question <em>which resource</em>, rather than the
		  question <em>what is this resource</em>.</p>
		
		<p>If XSPF is not a catalog format, what is it?  XSPF is an
		  intermediate format.  We expected a new kind of software called
		  a <em>content resolver</em> to do the job of converting XSPF to a
		  plain old list of files or URLs.  A content resolver would be
		  smart enough to keep your playlists from breaking when you move
		  your MP3s from /mp3s to /music/mp3.  It would be able to figure
		  out that a playlist entry by the artist "Hank Williams" with the
		  title "Your Cheating Heart" could be satisfied by the file
		  /mp3s/hankwilliams/yourcheatingheart.mp3.  It might even know how
		  to query the iTunes music store or another online provider to
		  locate and download a missing song.</p>
		
		<p>The content resolver maintains the catalog of your songs in
		  whatever format it prefers.  It might use a flatfile, a file in
		  the Berkeley DB format, or a SQL database.  It might use only ID3
		  metadata, but it might also know how to query MusicBrainz or
		  another metadata service.</p>
