    <h1>The XSPF Playlist Format, version 0</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This document describes a playlist format named "XSPF", which
      stands for "XML Shareable Playlist Format". "XSPF" can be
      pronounced "spiff" or perhaps "spliff."</p>

    The genesis of this project came from the mutual recognition that the quality of
    playlist formats fell far below the normal standard for hypertext document types like
    HTML, RDF and Atom. Our goals were to create a playlist format that is all three of: 
    <ol>
      <li>Open -- existing formats are either ad-hoc standards with no owner, like M3U,
		or proprietary, like ASX.</li>
      <li>Portable -- you should be able to send a playlist sans
		content to your friend, or open the same playlist with
		different software on the same machine, and have it be
		usable. Existing formats lack a number of features needed to
		make this work well.</li>
      <li>Well made -- there is a glaring lack of craftsmanship to
		existing formats.  For example, no dominant playlist format
		declares a namespace.  And while there are independent efforts
		to write a format with a high level of craftsmanship, the
		Gnomoradio format for example, writing data formats is too
		hard to succeed without a team.</li>
    </ol>

	<p>Over the course of our work we also realized that the format
	  had to scale down well.  The dominant playlist format is M3U,
	  which is just a flat listing of song paths, and many developers
	  are satisfied enough to stick with it.  SMIL is all three of
	  open, portable and well made, but is too complex for many needs;
	  simple SMIL playlists are not simple to implement.  Similarly,
	  RDF had well made solutions to many problems we faced, but RDF
	  tools are never trivial (as of this writing).  We went to great
	  lengths to make trivial playlists trivial to implement.</p>


    <h2>Publication Status and authorship</h2>

    <p>This is an informal document not associated with any standards
      body. It is intended to be clear and readable rather than
      conformant with existing standards for such documents.</p>

    <p>The home of our working group is <a href="http://xspf.org">http://xspf.org</a>. On
      IRC, we use #playlist on irc.freenode.net. There are perhaps six regular
      contributors, with another six commenting from time to time. Contributors came from
      two major audio software vendors, a major weblog aggregator, the W3C, and two
      significant .org sites related to music. We worked in the skunkworks style and were
      not sponsored by any organization or standards body. Our purpose was to engineer a
      high-quality design rather than to create normative requirements for
      interoperability.</p>

    <p>This document is maintained by <a href="http://gonze.com">Lucas Gonze</a> with help from members of the XSPF WG including Matthias Friedrich.</p>
      <p>Creation date of this document is Sunday, May 9, 2004.  The most recent edit is July 4, 2004.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    A very simple playlist looks like this: 
    <p class="example">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;playlist xmlns = "http://playlist.musicbrainz.org/playlist/moin.cgi/FrontPage/"&gt;
  &lt;trackList&gt;
    &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo+La+Tengo/And+Then+Nothing+Turned+Itself+Inside-Out&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
    &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo+La+Tengo/Genius+%2B+Love+%3D+Yo+La+Tengo+%28Disc+2%29&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
    &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo+La+Tengo/I+Can+Hear+The+Heart+Beating+As+One&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
    &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo+La+Tengo/Nuclear+War&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
    &lt;track&gt;&lt;location&gt;file:///mp3s/Yo+La+Tengo/Summer+Sun&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/track&gt;
  &lt;/trackList&gt; 
&lt;/playlist&gt;</p>
