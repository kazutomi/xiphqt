oggsplit - splits multiplexed Ogg files

  oggsplit is a simple tool for splitting multiplexed (grouped or chained)
  Ogg files into separate streams. It can thus be used to take apart
  two concatenated streams (i.e. it undoes the process of
  cat file1.ogg file2.ogg > file3.ogg) or to split two streams which are
  grouped, for example the video and audio streams in a theora+vorbis
  file.

  See the manfile (man oggsplit) for usage information.

  Comments and bugfixes are welcome.
