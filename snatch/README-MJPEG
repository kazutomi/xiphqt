Converting Snatch capture files to MPEG audio/video with MJPEG-1.4.1

****************************** ABOUT ******************************

mjpegtools-1.4.1 is a nice little collection of MPEG audio and video
utilities that, for the most part, work out of the box.  The output
quality is very nice, and the tool set is intelligently arranged.

The various tools in the mjpeg-tools trade video in YUV format and
audio as WAV.  Snatch support for mjpegtools consists of two
conversion utilities, snatch2wav and snatch2yuv (naturally, these
utilities need not be used only with mjpegtools.

Converting a snatch capture file to MPEG video using mjpeg is done in
three steps: encode audio to MPEG-1 layer 2 audio using snatch2wav and
mp2enc(.mp2), encode the video to MPEG-1/2 video using snatch2yuv and
mpeg2enc and then multiplexing the audio/video into a complete MPEG
video stream with mplex.  All of these tools are included in the package.

***************************** INSTALL *****************************

The official home of mjpegtools is http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/ Note
that the official mjpegtools-1.4.1 has a few annoying build and option
parsing bugs.  I've patched the bugs I've found, as well as added the
Snatch conversion utility source to my own distribution of the
mjpegtools source:

A patch against stock mjpegtools-1.4.1 can be found at: 
http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/x/i/xiphmont/Public/Snatch/mjpegtools-1.4.1-snatchpatch.diff

The complete source with patch already applied is at:
http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/x/i/xiphmont/Public/Snatch/mjpegtools-1.4.1-snatch.tgz

If you just want the utilities, the source files 'snatchconvert.c',
'snatch2yuv.c' and 'snatch2wav.c' are included in the main
distribution.  They build/work fine without mjpegtools.

When building mjpeg-tools, pay attention to the INSTALL document in
the mjpegtools tarball.  Things will probably go wrong if you don't
read it.

One trick wrt Debian and installing quicktime4linux through dpkg/apt;
the mjpeg tools build system is confused by it being installed, but
not where 'INSTALL' suggests putting it.  When running configure, do
like:

./configure --with-quicktime=/usr/include/quicktime

****************************** USAGE ******************************

Once installed, snatch2wav and snatch2yuv work just like the other
mjpeg 'xxxx2wav' and 'xxx2yuv' tools.  The command line options are
different, but snatch2wav -h and snatch2yuv -h will give a clear
summary.

The basic idea:

Encode an .mp2 audio file from the Snatch capture file using 
snatch2wav < capture.snatch | mp2enc -o temp.mp2

Encode an .m1v video file from the Snatch capture file using 
snatch2yuv -f fpscode < capture.snatch | mpeg2enc -a 1 -f fpscode -o temp.mp2

Multiplex them into one movie file:
mplex temp.mp2 temp.m1v -o output.mpeg

(the standalone .mp2 and .m1v files are valid MPEG audio and video
files respectively; you don't *have* to multiplex if you only want the
sound or only want the video).

Some notes before we get onto examples:

1) snatch2yuv doesn't currently do any scaling.  The size options
   merely letterbox/crop.  That's OK, mpeg2enc will encode practically
   any frame size.

2) snatch2yuv does not autosense frame rate.  Real frame rates are
   going to be weird, non-MPEG ones for the most part, so choosing an
   even multiple of the Real frame rate is the best bet.  Eg, if the
   Real stream was 15fps, select '30fps' when using snatch2yuv; it
   will do the pullup/pulldown automatically. see snatch2yuv -h for a 
   list of frame rates/

   snatch2yuv will stuff the capture data into any frame rate the user
   selects; choosing the wrong one will work, it will just be jerky
   and not smooth.

3) audio/video sync is Just Not A Concern.  Snatch records timing data
   in the capture file; snatch2wav pays attention to the video timing
   when extracting audio and snatch2yuv watches the audio when
   extracting video.  The separated audio and video will always be in
   sync unless explicitly requested otherwise.

4) It's possible a capture file will contain different sampling rates
   or mixed frame sizes/rates; this can happen if the window is
   resized, congestion causes a change in stream rate, etc.

   snatch2wav will resample the capture data into a uniform output
   automatically; by default it forces all output audio to the
   rate/channels it sees in the file first.  The user can override
   these settings.  mp2enc is also capable of resampling, but it want
   to see a file all in one format.

   snatch2yuv, similarly, forces all output to the same frame rate and
   frame size.

Now for a real example:

snatch2wav < 20011115_22:00:10_mono22050Hz_320x240_AV.snatch | \
	   mp2enc -m -b 128 -o temp.mp2

snatch2yuv -f 5 < 20011115_22:00:10_mono22050Hz_320x240_AV.snatch | \
	   mpeg2enc -a 1 -f 5 -b 576 -o temp.m1v

mplex temp.mp2 temp.m1v -o out.mpeg

The first line instructs snatch2wav to convert the audio from the
.snatch file into standard RIFF WAV (but without the length tag set.
That won't be an issue here).  mp2enc then turns that WAV into a 128
kbps mono mpeg2 file.  These options can vary (and are not actually
necessary at all).

The second line instructs snatch2yuv to convert the video from the
capture file into YUV 4:2:0 (also called YV12), the format preferred
by mpeg2enc.  The frame rate here is 'MPEG frame rate # 5', which
equals 30fps.  In this case, the input was 15fps, so snatch2yuv is
doing an automatic pullup.  mpeg2enc then produces an output video in
MPEG format consisting of square pixels (-a 1) 30fps (-f 5 , the
number given to -f should match the one given to snatch2yuv unless
you're doing something deliberately odd), 576kbps (-b 576).

The third line mixes the audio and video files into the final stream.
