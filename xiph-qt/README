XiphQT
======

XiphQT, the Xiph QuickTime Components, is a collection of QuickTime
and MacOS X 'plug-ins' providing support for the Xiph.Org Foundation's
(http://www.xiph.org/) multimedia compression formats.


Building
========

The XiphQT source code is accompanied by a set of Xcode project files,
and can be built easily using Xcode GUI or 'xcodebuild' command line tool.
The only additional requirement besides the developer tools, is set of
Xiph frameworks for particular compression formats, installed where Xcode
can find them (preferably - /Library/Frameworks).


Installing
==========

The binary component bundles need to be installed in specific locations
on your hard drive. Bundles with names starting with 'CA' go to
/Library/Components (or ~/Library/Components) and all other go to
/Library/QuickTime (or ~/Library/QuickTime).
You will also need to install Xiph library frameworks in either
/Library/Frameworks (or ~/Library/Frameworks).

The lastest version of XiphQT makes use of the following frameworks:
Ogg, Vorbis, FLAC, FLAC++, Speex and TheoraExp. Those can be build
from the corresponding Xiph format libraries, or the binary versions
can be obtained from the project downloads page:
http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/download.html .
